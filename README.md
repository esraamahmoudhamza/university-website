# university-website
I developed a university website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring college details, departments, and course descriptions. Each course had a brief summary to aid understanding. A "Contact Us" section enhanced communication. The project improved my front-end skills and ability to design user-friendly, structured educational web solutions.
