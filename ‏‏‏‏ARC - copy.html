            <h2>What Is Computer Architecture?</h2>
            <p>Computer architecture can be defined as a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, management and implementation of 
                computers. To be precise, it is nothing but rules by which a system performs and operates.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Functional units of a computer</h3>
            <p>Functions performed by a computer are:
                Accepting information to be processed as input.
                Storing a list of instructions to process the information.
                Processing the information according to the list of instructions.
                Providing the results of the processing as output.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>How are the functional units connected? </h3>
            <p>Functional units may be connected by a group of parallel wires - called a bus.
                Each wire in a bus can transfer one bit of information.
                The number of parallel wires in a bus is equal to the word length of a computer</p>
            <br>
            <h3>What are the types of information in a computer?</h3>
            <p>Information fed to/stored in a computer is either</p>
            <p>1- Instructions</p>
            <p>A sequence of instructions to perform a task is called a program, which is stored in the memory.</p>
            <p>2- Data</p>
            <p>Data are the “operands” upon which instructions operate.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>What is the memory unit?</h3>
            <p>Memory unit stores instructions and data.
                *Data is represented as a series of bits.
                *To store data, memory unit means storing bits</p>
            <p>Processor reads instructions and reads/writes data from/to the memory during the execution of a program. </p>
            <p>Memory and processor have to “communicate” with each other in order to read/write information.</p>
            <p>In theory, instructions and data could be fetched one bit at a time.
                In practice, a group of bits is fetched at a time.</p>
            <p>Group of bits stored or retrieved at a time is termed as “word”
                Number of bits in a word is termed as the “word length” of a computer.</p>
            <p>In order to read/write to and from memory, a processor should know where to look:
                “Address” is associated with each word location.
                Random Access Memory (RAM) provides fixed access time independent of the location of the word. 
                Access time is known as “Memory Access Time”.</p>
            <p>In order to reduce “communication time”, a small amount of RAM (known as Cache) is tightly coupled with the processor.
                Modern computers have three to four levels of RAM units with different speeds and sizes:
                Fastest, smallest known as Cache
                Slowest, largest known as Main memory.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="images\69.png" alt="">
            <h3>Secondary storage</h3>
            <p>Store large amounts of data on secondary storage devices:
                Magnetic disks and tapes, 
                Optical disks (CD-ROMS).
                Access to the data stored in secondary storage in slower, but take advantage of the fact that some information may be accessed  
                infrequently.
                Cost of a memory unit depends on its access time, lesser access time implies higher cost.</p>
                <img src="images\941e1b20-6aec-4617-80ee-3edcfac7610e_900_900.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <h3>Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)</h3>
            <p>Operations are executed in the Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU).
                Arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction.
                Logic operations such as comparison of numbers.</p>
            <p>In order to execute an instruction, operands need to be brought into the ALU from the memory. 
                Operands are stored in general purpose registers available in the ALU.
                Access times of general purpose registers are faster than the cache.  
                Results of the operations are stored back in the memory or retained in the processor for immediate use.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Control unit</h3>
            <p>Operations of Input unit, Memory, ALU and Output unit are coordinated by Control unit.
                Instructions control “what” operations take place (e.g. data transfer, processing).
                Control unit generates timing signals which determines “when” a particular operation takes place.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Instruction Execution Cycle</h3>
            <img src="images\Picture3.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <h3>RAM DRAM (Dynamic RAM) vs Cache  SRAM (Static RAM)</h3>
            <p>Both RAM and Cache memories are used to store temporary data close to the processor for ease of information retrieval.</p>
            <p>However, each of them is differently constructed which makes their price, size, speed method of data access different than each 
                other.</p>
            <img src="images\image.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <h3>Memory location and memory content (word)</h3>
            <p>The memory is considered as a place to store information accessible using an address.
                Memory Address is used to access the word
                The word length is independent of the memory size
                The memory size (M) = 2n where n is the length of the memory address</p>
            <img src="images\222-10.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>How Cache and RAM cooperate? </h3>
            <p>Cache memory is intended to give memory speed approaching that of the processor and registers.
                The cache contains a copy of portions of main memory. 
                When the processor attempts to read a word of memory, a check is made to determine if the word is in the cache.</p>
            <p>If it exist in the cache, the word is delivered to the processor. 
                If not found in the cache, we have to bring it from the main memory. 
                Instead of transferring one word at a time, a block of main memory, consisting of some fixed number of words, is read into cache 
                and then the word is delivered to the processor.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Why we transfer blocks from main memory to cache?</h3>
            <p>When a block of data is fetched into the cache to satisfy a single memory reference, it is likely that there will be future 
                reference to that same memory location or to other words in the block.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Types of Cache organization </h3>
            <p>1. Fully Associative </p>
            <p>2. Direct Mapped</p>
            <p>3. Set Associative</p>
            <img src="images\maxresdefault.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            <h3>Cache miss and cache hit</h3>
            <p>These two words express finding a word in the cache (cache hit) and not finding the word in the cache (cache miss).
                Cache hit implies direct access to the word
                Cache miss implies we have to fetch the block containing the word from main memory to the cache then deliver it to the processor. 
                This will take longer time (cache miss penalty)
                Hit ratio = percentage of memory accesses satisfied by the cache.</p>
            <h3>A cache hit ratio</h3>
            <p>Miss ratio = 1- Hit ratio
                A cache hit ratio is calculated by dividing the number of cache hits by the total number of cache hits and misses.
                It measures how effective a cache is at fulfilling requests for content.
                Larger blocks reduce cache misses through spatial locality</p>

            <h3>Block Replacement Algorithms </h3>
            <img src="images\Page-Replacement_4.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <h3>Cache to Memory Write Policy</h3>
            <p>1.Write-through</p>
            <p>2.Write-back</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Word addressing VS byte addressing</h3>
            <p>Byte addressable memory is best suited for the processes that need a single byte data at a time. 
                Word addressable memory is suitable for processes that requires data comprising single word at a time</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Buses inside the computer</h3>
            <p>Its idea is based on that at any time, only one device is allowed to use the bus (register, ALU, memory, any connected component). 
                Therefore, this common usage of a single device yields a communication bottleneck. 
                The bus speed is determined according to its:
                --- length and 
                --- number of devices using it in common.</p>
            <h3>Type of buses</h3>
            <p>Data bus</p>
            <p>Address Bus</p>
            <p>Control Bus</p>
            <h3>How buses are implemented?</h3>
            <p>1- Using Multiplexers</p>
            <p>2- Using Three state buffer</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Permanent Storage Devices</h3>

            <p>Harddisk</p>
            <p>CD</p>
            <p>ROM</p>
